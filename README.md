## 📱 About ScreenX

**ScreenX** is a modern, high-performance screen recording utility built for Android. It prioritizes smooth performance, minimal system overhead, and useful productivity features like live annotations and floating overlays. Whether you're recording gameplay, creating app walkthroughs, or capturing bug reports, ScreenX handles it with style.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🎥 High-Fidelity Recording
* **Custom Configurations:** Adjust video resolution (up to 1080p+), frame rates (30 FPS, 60 FPS), and video/audio bitrates to balance quality and file size.
* **Format Control:** Generates highly compatible `.mp4` video files using Android's hardware-accelerated MediaCodec API.
* **Dynamic Orientation:** Automatically adapts recording orientation based on your device state.

### 🎙️ Audio Capture
* **Audio Sources:** Record clear external microphone audio or internal system audio (Android 10+).
* **Custom Quality:** Configure sample rates and audio bitrates for crystal-clear sound.

### 🖌️ Live Annotations & Brush Tools
* **Draw on Screen:** Activate the drawing overlay to annotate, circle, or write directly on top of active apps while recording.
* **Custom Styling:** Choose from standard brush colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) and adjust brush size dynamically.
* **Quick Clear:** Easily erase strokes or clear the entire canvas with a single tap from the overlay controls.

### 🎛️ Floating Control Panel
* **Quick Access:** A non-intrusive overlay button that expands into standard record/pause/stop and brush tools.
* **Smart Placement:** Drag-and-drop floating widget that snaps to the edges of the screen and remembers its position.
* **Auto-Hide:** Automatically hides itself during inactive periods or shifts visibility according to settings.

### ⚡ Quick Settings Tile Integration
* **One-Tap Recording:** Initiate or stop screen recordings instantly directly from the Android Quick Settings panel without opening the app UI.
* **Seamless Launching:** Handles foreground service and media projection requests seamlessly in the background.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

ScreenX is designed with modern Android development practices, ensuring scalability, performance, and clean code division:

* **Language:** 100% Kotlin
* **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3 (Material You dynamic theme support)
* **Background Tasks:** Android Foreground Services (`ScreenRecordService`) with high-priority Notification channels
* **Media Pipelines:** MediaProjection API, MediaRecorder, and custom AudioPlaybackCapture configurations
* **State Management:** Kotlin Coroutines and Flows for reactive settings management
* **Data Layer:** Jetpack DataStore / SharedPreferences for storing user configurations
